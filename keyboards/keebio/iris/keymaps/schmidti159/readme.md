# A Neo based keymap with home row mods
![Layout Image](https://i.imgur.com/S6Bbnm6.png)

## Basics - Layers
The layout is inspired by the german [Neo-Layout](https://neo-layout.org/) but removes the layers 5, 6 and the symbols on the number row.
Instead it uses the thumb keys for layer access and home row modifiers for the standard modifiers.
Additionally a 2nd function layer can be activated with the pinkies and used to trigger macros.
The master layer is used for multimedia, keyboard and mouse controls.

## Encoders
My iris has 2 rotary encoders, that behave differently on different layers (see image above).
